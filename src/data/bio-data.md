Hi, I'm Andrew 👋🏾 An engineer, educator, and entreprenuer living in Alameda, CA.  
\
I grew up with legos, Toy Story, and wildberry toaster strudels. It makes sense why I love building things, compelling stories, and flaky pastries of every kind. 😅 At my core, I'm a problem solver that values using the right tool for the job, software or otherwise. Those who know me know I value process, quality, and creativity.

Beyond the computer screen, I'm a man of faith and foodie on a quest to collect more passport stamps. Thanks for checking out my site.
